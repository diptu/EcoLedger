## ✅ 2. Core Auth & Users
- [] User model (`User`)  
- [] Fields: id, email, hashed_password, role, is_active, is_superuser, 
      created_at, updated_at  
- [] CRUD operations (`get_user_by_email`, `create_user`, etc.)  
- [] Email verification flow for new users as a background task  
- [] Password reset workflow (token + email) as a background task  
- [] Unique constraints on email and username  
- [] Pydantic schemas (`UserCreate`, `UserLogin`, etc.)  
- [] Account deactivation / deletion endpoints  

---

## ✅ 3. JWT Authentication
- [] Implement access + refresh tokens  
- [] `create_access_token`, `create_refresh_token`, `decode_token`  
- [] Login endpoint issues both tokens  
- [] Refresh endpoint issues new access token  
- [] Token expiration handling (access short-lived, refresh long-lived)  
- [] Rotate refresh tokens on usage for better security  
- [] Blacklist expired/revoked refresh tokens (Redis recommended)  
- [] JWT key rotation support for long-term security  

---

## ✅ 4. RBAC / Roles
- [] Enum for `UserRole` (USER, ADMIN)  
  - [] Consider hierarchical roles (USER < MODERATOR < ADMIN)  
- [] Include role in JWT payload  
- [] `require_roles` dependency for endpoint protection  
  - [] Add endpoint decorators for role checks  
- [] Admin-only and user-or-admin endpoints  
- [] Unit tests for role enforcement  

---

## ⏳ 5. Social Login / OAuth 2.0
- [] Integrate providers: Google, Facebook, GitHub, Apple  
- [] Handle OAuth flow:  
  - [] Verify provider tokens on server side  
  - [] Frontend redirects to provider login  
  - [] Provider returns authorization code / token  
  - [] Exchange code for user info  
- [] Auto-create new user if first-time login  
- [] Issue standard JWT access + refresh tokens  
- [] Include role in JWT payload  
- [] Optional: Link multiple social accounts to the same user  
  - [] Store provider IDs and link multiple accounts to same user  
- [] Add rate limiting for login attempts to prevent abuse  
- [] Optional: Profile picture / basic info sync from provider  

---

## ✅ 6. Tests & Quality
- [] Unit & integration tests  
- [] JWT flows, refresh tokens, role enforcement  
- [] pytest for async endpoints  
- [] mypy type checking  
- [] pylint linting  
- [] Code documentation  
- [] End-to-end tests (simulate OAuth and token refresh)  
- [] Load tests / stress tests for 200M users scale  
- [] Database migration tests with Alembic  
- [] CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions or GitLab) to run lint, typecheck, tests  

---

## ⏳ 7. Remaining Enhancements
- [] Refresh token revocation / blacklist (Redis or DB-backed)  
- [] Rate limiting / brute-force prevention (Redis recommended)  
- [] Detailed OpenAPI documentation with ResponseModel examples  
- [] CI/CD linting & test automation  
  - [] Dockerize tests from inside `infra/` directory  
- [] Dockerize the service from inside `infra/` directory  
- [] Build container image  
- [] Configure environment variables (DB, JWT, Redis)  
- [] Kubernetes deployment manifests  
  - [] Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret  
  - [] Include Redis as sidecar or external service  
- [] Health endpoints for DB, Redis, external services (using ResponseModel)  
- [] Metrics / Prometheus integration for monitoring  
- [] Tracing (OpenTelemetry) for distributed requests  
- [] Secrets management (Vault or K8s Secrets) for sensitive data  
- [] Horizontal scaling considerations: sticky sessions, load balancer  
- [] Caching layer (Redis or in-memory) for frequently requested data  
- [] API versioning (`/v1`, `/v2`)  
- [] Graceful startup / shutdown events for FastAPI
